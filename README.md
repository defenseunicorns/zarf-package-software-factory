# zarf-package-software-factory
Zarf Package of a Software Factory (a.k.a. "DI2-ME")

:construction: **This project is still early in its development.** Early adopters are expected to have a good understanding of how Kubernetes works as well as how to operate and maintain the various services present in this package. This package is intended to significantly speed up the initial deployment and configuration of a software factory, as well as provide a simple upgrade path for updates and security fixes. It will not absolve the user from understanding what it takes to operate a software factory in a production setting.

Deploys the components of a software factory with the following services, all running on top of Big Bang Core:

- GitLab*
- GitLab Runner*
- Minio Operator*
- Neuvector*
- SonarQube*
- Jira
- Confluence
- Jenkins
- Artifactory
- HA Redis with Sentinel

Coming Soon:

- Mattermost*

**Deployed using Big Bang Umbrella*

---

**The requirements of the package on a single node/machine are roughly 48 CPU threads, 96 GB of memory, and a directly attached NVME solid-state storage device of at least 500k IOPS.**

## Zarf Compatibility
All versions of this package will not be compatible with all versions of Zarf. For maximum repeatability each version of this package expects a specific version of Zarf. This is taken care of by using `make` targets that download the correct version of Zarf to the `/build` directory. When you run `make all` you're downloading the right version of Zarf automatically.

## Known Issues

- The Neuvector CVE database is kept up to date via an image. This means that unless an updated image is pulled from IronBank and deployed to the cluster via zarf the database will be out of date. The day2 package has the image as an optional component as an easy way to update it.

- This package is currently incompatible with k3s. k3s seems to get overloaded from the amount of API requests generated by postgres DBs + istio injection and then blocks all API requests from any offending namespace. This issue has been unreproducable on any other k8s distro. For testing we use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

- If the StorageClass being used is set to `WaitForFirstConsumer` GitLab's HelmRelease will not reconcile until a backup is triggered. Run the following command to manually trigger a backup:

    ```bash
    kubectl create job -n gitlab --from=cronjob/gitlab-toolbox-backup gitlab-toolbox-backup-manual
    ```

- :warning: We do not currently test compatibility from one version to the next. The user of this package is expected to first deploy to a test environment when doing upgrades. We will start testing upgrade paths as we get closer to a v1.0 release.

- Jenkins won't work in disconnected environments due to its dependency on plugins pulled from the internet. Work is needed to figure out and implement a method of doing locally sourced plugins. Jira and Confluence plugins will have the same issue.

- The current deployment of HA Redis with Sentinel is deployed with no authentication. Please reference [ADR-002](doc/adr/0002-switch-to-authless-ha-redis.md) for additional details.

## Prerequisites

- [Logged into registry1.dso.mil](https://docs.zarf.dev/docs/the-zarf-cli/cli-commands/zarf_tools_registry_login)
- `make` present in PATH
- `sha256sum` present in PATH
- TONS of CPU and RAM with high IOPS storage. Our testing shows the AWS EC2 instance type m6id.16xlarge works pretty well at about $3.80/hour, which can be reduced further if you do a spot instance.

Note that having Zarf installed is not a prerequisite. This repo pulls in its own version of Zarf so that it can be versioned separately from whatever your system has installed. To change the version of Zarf used modify the ZARF_VERSION variable in the Makefile

## Documentation

To run this package in "self-contained" mode, follow these steps.

> "self-contained" mode means the package will deploy its own PostgreSQL databases and S3 buckets, using Zalando's Postgres Operator and MinIO, respectively.

1. [Fork the repo, customize, and build the packages](doc/fork-and-build.md)
1. [Deploy](doc/deploy.md)
1. [Configure SOPS encryption](doc/sops.md)
1. [Configure Single Sign-On](doc/sso.md)
1. [Day-2 Ops/Maintenance/Upgrades](doc/day2.md)
1. [Backup and Restore](doc/backup-and-restore/README.md)
1. [Troubleshooting](doc/troubleshooting.md)

If you want to customize your deployment by utilizing external PostgreSQL databases and S3 buckets, you can additionally follow along with these docs:

1. [Disable Postgres Operator and MinIO](doc/disable-postgres-operator-and-minio.md)
1. [Configure GitLab to use an external database and S3 buckets](doc/configure-gitlab-to-use-an-external-database-and-s3-buckets.md)
1. [Configure Jira to use an external database](doc/configure-jira-to-use-an-external-database.md)
