## Zarf Compatibility
All versions of this package will not be compatible with all versions of Zarf. Here's a compatibility matrix to use to determine which versions match up

| Package Version                                                                                                                                                                   | Zarf Version                                                             |

## Known Issues

- Jenkins won't work in disconnected environments due to its dependency on plugins pulled from the internet. Work is needed to figure out and implement a method of doing locally sourced plugins.

- Due to issues with Elasticsearch this package doesn't work yet in some k8s distros. It does work in K3s (using `zarf init --components k3s,gitops-service`). Upcoming work to swap the EFK stack out for the PLG stack (Promtail, Loki, Grafana) should resolve this issue. Keep in mind the big note above about the package being huge. Unless you have the Mother of All Laptops you'll need to turn a bunch of stuff off before you try to deploy it locally using Vagrant.

- If you are using Vagrant, inside the Vagrant VM the services are available on the standard port 443. Outside the VM if you want to pull something up in your browser that traffic is being routed to port **8443** to avoid needing to be root when running the Vagrant box.

## Prerequisites

- [Logged into registry1.dso.mil](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/blob/master/docs/ironbank.md)
- Clone this repo
- `make` present in PATH
- `sha256sum` present in PATH
- `envsubst` present in PATH
- TONS of CPU and RAM. Our testing shows the AWS EC2 instance type m6i.8xlarge works pretty well at about $1.50/hour, which can be reduced further if you do a spot instance.
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), only if you are going to use a Vagrant VM, which is incompatible when using an EC2 instance.

Note that having Zarf installed is not a prerequisite. This repo pulls in its own version of Zarf so that it can be versioned separately from whatever your system has installed. To change the version of Zarf used modify the ZARF_VERSION variable in the Makefile
